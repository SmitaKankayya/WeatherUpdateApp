# WeatherUpdateApp
WeatherUpdateApp is a simple iOS application that fetches real-time weather data using the WeatherAPI.

The app displays information such as updated time, region, country, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

Additionally, the snippet adds a gradient background to the parent UIView using a CAGradientLayer. 

The gradient transitions from a deep blue (UIColor.systemBlue) to a vibrant green (UIColor.systemGreen).

The gradient layer is strategically inserted at the bottom of the view's layer hierarchy (index 0) to ensure it acts as the background, complementing the styled labels and providing an engaging visual effect.
